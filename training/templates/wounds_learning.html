        <p>
            Wounds occur when the skin or body tissues break due to cuts, scrapes, or punctures.  
            While minor wounds can be treated at home, some cases require medical attention to prevent complications.
        </p>

        <h3>When to Seek Medical Attention</h3>
        <p>Seek professional care if any of the following apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uncontrolled Bleeding:</strong> Bleeding does not stop after 10-15 minutes of direct pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep or Large Wounds:</strong> If a wound is deeper than 1/4 inch or exposes fat or muscle, stitches may be needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Concerns:</strong> Wounds on the face, hands, feet, genitals, or over major joints should be evaluated due to functional and cosmetic risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreign Objects:</strong> If debris remains embedded after cleaning, medical help is needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Animal or Human Bites:</strong> High risk of infection; often requires antibiotics.</li>
            <li><strong>Tetanus Risk:</strong> Wounds from dirty or rusty objects need attention, especially if vaccinations are outdated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>First Aid Treatment at Home</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wash Your Hands:</strong> Prevent infection by cleaning your hands before touching the wound.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop the Bleeding:</strong> Apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or bandage.</li>
            <li><strong>Clean the Wound:</strong> Rinse under running water to remove dirt. Avoid soap directly in the wound.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply Antibiotic Ointment:</strong> Helps prevent infection and keeps the wound moist.</li>
            <li><strong>Protect the Wound:</strong> Cover with a sterile bandage, changing it daily or when dirty.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor for Infection:</strong> Watch for redness, swelling, or pus development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recognizing Infection After a Few Days</h3>
        <p>Even with proper care, infections may develop. Watch for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased Redness & Swelling:</strong> Spreading redness or swelling around the wound.</li>
            <li><strong>Pus or Discharge:</strong> Yellow or green fluid oozing from the wound.</li>
            <li><strong>Fever:</strong> A temperature above 100.4°F (38°C) may indicate an infection.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent Pain:</strong> Pain that worsens or does not improve.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If any of these symptoms occur, seek medical attention to prevent serious complications.
