        <p>
            Burns are common injuries caused by exposure to extreme temperatures.  
            Thermal burns occur due to heat exposure, such as cooking accidents or hot water.  
            Ice burns are caused by freezing temperatures, often affecting outdoor workers or adventurers.
        </p>

        <h3>When to Go to the Hospital?</h3>
        <p>
            Burns are classified based on their depth and tissue damage:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First-Degree Burns (Superficial):</strong> Mild discomfort, red and slightly inflamed skin. Heals within 7-10 days. Seek medical help if the burn is large or in a sensitive area like the hands, feet, joints, or groin.</li>
            <li><strong>Second-Degree Burns (Partial Thickness):</strong> Red, white, or splotchy skin with blisters. Moderate to severe pain. A hospital visit is recommended if pain is severe or if the burn is in a sensitive area.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Degree Burns (Full Thickness):</strong> White, brown, or blackened skin with a leathery texture. Often numb due to nerve damage. Immediate medical attention is critical to prevent loss of movement or life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Treat a Burn at Home?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cool the Burn:</strong> Run cool (not cold) water over the area for 10 minutes to reduce pain and swelling. Avoid using ice.</li>
            <li><strong>Protect the Burn:</strong> Cover with a clean, non-stick bandage or cloth. Do not use adhesive bandages directly on the burn.</li>
            <li><strong>Relieve Pain:</strong> Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce pain and inflammation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recognizing Infection</h3>
        <p>
            If the burn does not improve and the injured person experiences increasing pain, redness, pus, or fever, the burn may be infected. Seek medical help immediately.
        </p>

        <h3>Ice Burns or Frostbite</h3>
        <p>
            Ice burns (frostbite) are less common than thermal burns. Symptoms include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pain, numbness, hard or waxy skin.</li>
            <li>Frostbite can occur even if the skin looks normal initially.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Treatment:</strong> Gently warm the area using a cloth soaked in warm water. Do not rub the skin.  
            Seek medical help if the injured person is not warming up or has other exposure-related issues.
