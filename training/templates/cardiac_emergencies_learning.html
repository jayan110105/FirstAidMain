    <h2 class="text-center">Cardiac Emergencies</h2>

    <p>
        Cardiac emergencies occur when the heart stops functioning properly, cutting off blood flow to vital organs. 
        Without immediate action, this can lead to death within minutes. Recognizing the signs and responding quickly 
        can double or triple survival chances.
    </p>

    <h3>Recognizing a Cardiac Emergency</h3>
    <p>Someone experiencing a cardiac event may show the following symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sudden collapse and unresponsiveness</li>
        <li>No breathing or gasping for air</li>
        <li>No pulse or very weak pulse</li>
        <li>Clutching the chest (in cases of a heart attack)</li>
        <li>Dizziness, confusion, or extreme fatigue</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you suspect a cardiac emergency, act immediately—every second counts.</p>

    <h3>Immediate Actions to Take</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check Responsiveness:</strong> Shake the person and shout their name. If no response, proceed immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Call Emergency Services:</strong> Dial 911 (or your local emergency number) and report the situation. Stay on the line and follow instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Start CPR:</strong> Begin chest compressions immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Use an AED:</strong> If available, follow the instructions to deliver a shock.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CPR on Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Place the person on a firm, flat surface.</li>
        <li>Give hard, fast chest compressions (100-120 per minute). Push down at least 2 inches in the center of the chest.</li>
        <li>Allow the chest to fully rise between compressions.</li>
        <li>Continue until emergency responders arrive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CPR on Children</h3>
    <p>
        The main differences between child and adult CPR are in compression depth, hand placement, and rescue breaths 
        due to the size and fragility of a child’s body.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compression Depth:</strong> Compress about 2 inches, but no more than that to avoid injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Hand Placement:</strong> Use one or two hands, depending on the child’s size—one hand for smaller children and two for larger ones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Use an AED</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn it on and follow the voice prompts.</li>
        <li>Attach the electrode pads to the person’s bare chest as shown in the instructions.</li>
        <li>If advised, deliver a shock and immediately resume CPR.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Working with Other Bystanders</h3>
    <p>If others are present, assign specific tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One person should call emergency services.</li>
        <li>Another should locate and bring an AED.</li>
        <li>A third can assist with CPR rotation to prevent fatigue.</li>
    </ul>
